In my previous post, I recreated a post, originally published by [Sergio Zambrano](https://stackoverflow.com/users/595488/sergio) in 2012, showing how a simple custom font can be used to create a [semantic yet SEO friendly graph bar](https://cyberillo.com/semantic-yet-seo-friendly-graph-bar/).

In this post, I’ll be showing you a similar application of custom fonts; this time to create semantic yet SEO friendly rating stars for reviews. No JavaScript, no divs and no SVGs. Just a custom font-family and plain CSS.

Try it yourself
---------------

1.  Download the **seostars** fonts by Sergio Zambrano.
2.  Upload the individual folders to the **fonts** directory on your website.
3.  Add the code from **style.css** to your CSS stylesheet. Make sure to replace _yoursite.com_ with the URL of your website. This basically adds a reference to the custom fonts we uploaded and some basic CSS styling.
4.  Use the rating stars in your HTML code through the **seostars** class, which in turn uses the **seostars** fonts uploaded earlier. **Example.html** shows a use case of the stars.
